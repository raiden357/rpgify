# Project Name

Rpgify allows a user to turn their life into a customized role playing game. Users create skills which hold a level value. For each level the user specifies the achievement required to complete that level. Once that achievement is accomplished they advance a level. 


# Structure

The front end uses angular version 1.4. Restangular is used to make requests to backend resources that are listed in the swagger api documentation.

The back end uses Node.js to proxy the MongoDB database and receive REST requests from angular.
