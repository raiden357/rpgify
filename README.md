# RPGify node.js REST API

A node.js+MongoDB implementation of my side project created for getting experience using various frameworks.
The goal with this implementation is to get experience creating web apps with node.js and MongoDB.

*Rpgify* allows a user to turn their life into a customized role playing game.
Users create skills which hold a level value.
For each level the user specifies the achievements required to complete that level.
Once the achievements are accomplished they advance a level.
For each achievement completed, experience points are gained.
