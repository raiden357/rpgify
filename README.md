# Project Name

*Rpgify* allows a user to turn their life into a customized role playing game.
Users create skills which hold a level value.
For each level the user specifies the achievements required to complete that level.
Once the achievements are accomplished they advance a level.
For each achievement completed, experience points are gained.

# Structure

The front end uses angular version 1.4.
Restangular is used to make requests to backend resources that are

The back end uses Node.js to proxy the MongoDB database and receive
REST requests from angular.
